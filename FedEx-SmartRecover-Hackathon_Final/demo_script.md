# SmartRecover - 3-Minute Demo Script

## OPENING (30s)
"FedEx manages thousands of overdue accounts manually. This leads to lost revenue and compliance risks. Today, we're transforming that with **SmartRecover**."

## DEMO FLOW

### 1. The Problem (30s)
* **Visual:** Show a messy Excel sheet.
* **Script:** "Currently, we have no visibility and no accountability. Decisions are slow and reactive."

### 2. The Solution: AI Engine (60s)
* **Action:** Run `python ai_engine.py` in the terminal.
* **Script:** "Watch this. We are running our **Hybrid AI Engine**. It combines Machine Learning patterns with Business Rule guardrails."
* **Point to Output:** "Notice the 'Confidence Score'. If the AI isn't sure, it flags the case for human review. We prioritize safety over speed."

### 3. Business Impact (45s)
* **Visual:** Show the JSON Output KPIs.
* **Script:** "Look at the numbers. In this sample batch alone, we identified **$75,600 in commission savings** for the next quarter. We achieved a **100% auto-allocation rate**, freeing up hundreds of hours of manual work."

### 4. Governance (45s)
* **Visual:** Open `config/thresholds.yaml`.
* **Script:** "Best of all, this is fully configurable. If GDPR rules change in Europe, Ops teams update this YAML file. No code deployment needed."

## CLOSING (30s)
"SmartRecover isn't just a better spreadsheet. It's a decision intelligence ecosystem that learns, explains, and governs itself."
